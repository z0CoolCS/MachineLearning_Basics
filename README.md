# MachineLearning_Basics
This is a collection of some machine learning techniques.  

It includes:  
- Some gradients decents and some loss functions with an application on non lineal regression. The essay was over a seno function with some noise.
- A classification analysis over one of the most common dataset - Iris dataset. This analysis uses logitics regression to classify iris dataset. Additionally, it includes a softmax algorithm to get a classifier for 3 o more classes.
